# hello-world
just another repository

I have to keep close to hope and keep those who want to destroy my hope away.
I hope to have a comfortable life with my daughter Olivia.
I hope to find someone who respects me and doesn't treat me like a servant.
I hope to find people who are looking out for my best interests and not their own.
I am looking for my true partner in crime that I can depend and trust on.
